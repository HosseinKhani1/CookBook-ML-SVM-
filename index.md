# Mathematics behind Supposrt Vector Machines (SVM)

 Supposrt vector machine is one of the basic (binary) classifiers in machine learning based on supervised algorithms.
One of the considerable challenges to use this classifier is to know the mathematics behind the algorithm.
I believe that the only way to correctly use such algorithms is to know what they mathematically mean and how 
changes in small parameters may affect the whole process.
